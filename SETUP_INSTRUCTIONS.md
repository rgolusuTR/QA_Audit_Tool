# Final Setup Instructions

The QA Audit Tool has been successfully configured with GitHub Codespaces support! Here's what you need to do to complete the setup:

## Current Status ✅

- ✅ Frontend deployed to GitHub Pages: https://rgolusutr.github.io/QA_Audit_Tool/
- ✅ GitHub Codespaces configuration created (.devcontainer/)
- ✅ Frontend configured to automatically detect Codespace backend
- ✅ Error handling implemented for missing backend

## Next Step: Create the Codespace

**You need to create a GitHub Codespace to run the backend server:**

1. **Go to your repository**: https://github.com/rgolusuTR/QA_Audit_Tool

2. **Create Codespace**:

   - Click the green "Code" button
   - Select "Codespaces" tab
   - Click "Create codespace on master"

3. **Wait for automatic setup** (2-3 minutes):

   - Python 3.11 and Node.js 18 will be installed
   - All dependencies will be installed automatically
   - The backend server will start automatically on port 8000
   - Port 8000 will be configured with PUBLIC visibility

4. **Verify setup**:
   - Check that the backend is running in the terminal
   - Verify port 8000 is forwarded and set to PUBLIC
   - The Codespace URL will be something like: `https://[codespace-name]-8000.app.github.dev`

## How It Works

Once the Codespace is running:

1. **Frontend**: Users access https://rgolusutr.github.io/QA_Audit_Tool/
2. **Backend**: Automatically connects to your Codespace backend
3. **Full Functionality**: All QA audit features work without users needing local setup

## Important Notes

- **Keep the Codespace running**: The backend needs to be active for users to access the tool
- **Public port**: Port 8000 is configured for public access so all users can connect
- **Automatic startup**: The backend starts automatically when you open the Codespace
- **No user setup required**: End users just visit the GitHub Pages URL

## Troubleshooting

If the backend doesn't start automatically:

```bash
cd backend
python main.py
```

If port forwarding isn't working:

- Go to the "Ports" tab in VS Code
- Ensure port 8000 is set to "Public" visibility

## Success!

Once your Codespace is running, the QA Audit Tool will be fully functional for all users without requiring any local installation!
