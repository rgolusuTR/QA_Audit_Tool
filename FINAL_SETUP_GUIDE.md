# üöÄ Final Setup Guide - Complete Your QA Audit Tool Deployment

Your QA Audit Tool is 99% complete! Just follow these final steps to make it fully functional for all users.

## üìç Current Status

- ‚úÖ Frontend deployed: https://rgolusutr.github.io/QA_Audit_Tool/
- ‚úÖ Codespace "organic space fishstick" is ACTIVE
- ‚úÖ Backend setup script is running
- üîÑ **Final step needed**: Make backend port public

---

## üéØ Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Access Your Active Codespace

1. **Go to your Codespace**: You should see "organic space fishstick" is already active
2. **If not already open**: Click on your Codespace name to open it in VS Code

### Step 2: Check Backend Status

In your Codespace terminal, verify the backend is running:

```bash
# Check if backend is running
ps aux | grep python

# If not running, start it manually:
cd backend
python main.py
```

**Expected output**: You should see the FastAPI server starting on port 8000

### Step 3: Configure Port Visibility (CRITICAL STEP)

This is the most important step - making port 8000 publicly accessible:

#### Option A: Using VS Code Interface

1. **Look for the PORTS tab** at the bottom of VS Code (you saw "PORTS 5" in your screenshot)
2. **Click on the PORTS tab**
3. **Find port 8000** in the list
4. **Right-click on port 8000**
5. **Select "Change Port Visibility"**
6. **Choose "Public"**

#### Option B: Using Command Palette

1. **Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac)**
2. **Type**: "Codespaces: Change Port Visibility"
3. **Select port 8000**
4. **Choose "Public"**

#### Option C: Using Terminal Command

```bash
# Make port 8000 public via CLI
gh codespace ports visibility 8000:public
```

### Step 4: Verify Port Configuration

After setting port 8000 to public, verify it's working:

1. **Check the PORTS tab** - port 8000 should show as "Public"
2. **Copy the port 8000 URL** - it should look like:
   ```
   https://organic-space-fishstick-rqpqvrw99w4f57x4-8000.app.github.dev
   ```
3. **Test the backend** by visiting that URL in a browser - you should see a FastAPI response

### Step 5: Test the Complete System

1. **Open the frontend**: https://rgolusutr.github.io/QA_Audit_Tool/
2. **Enter a test URL**: `https://example.com`
3. **Click "Start QA Audit"**
4. **Expected result**: The tool should now connect to your Codespace backend and start the analysis!

## üîç Troubleshooting

### If Backend Won't Start

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

### If Port 8000 Isn't Listed

The backend might not be running. Start it manually:

```bash
cd backend
python main.py
```

Then refresh the PORTS tab.

### If Port Visibility Won't Change

Try using the command line method:

```bash
gh codespace ports visibility 8000:public
```

### If Frontend Still Shows Error

1. Wait 1-2 minutes for changes to propagate
2. Refresh the frontend page
3. Check browser console for any error messages
4. Verify the Codespace backend URL is accessible

---

## üéâ Success Indicators

You'll know it's working when:

1. **PORTS tab shows**: Port 8000 as "Public"
2. **Backend URL accessible**: You can visit the Codespace backend URL directly
3. **Frontend connects**: No more "Backend Connection Error" message
4. **QA Audit runs**: You can successfully analyze websites

---

## üìû Need Help?

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check the terminal** for any error messages
2. **Verify the backend is running** on port 8000
3. **Ensure port 8000 is set to Public** (this is the most common issue)
4. **Try restarting the Codespace** if nothing else works

Once port 8000 is public, your QA Audit Tool will be fully functional for all users worldwide! üåç
